 *
 * Problem Statement
 * Given an undirected graph containing 1  to n nodes. The graph is represented by a 2D array of edges,
 * where edges[i] = [ai, bi], represents an edge between ai, and bi.
 *
 * Identify one edge that, if removed, will turn the graph into a tree.
 *
 * A tree is a graph that is connected and has no cycles.
 *
 * Assume that the graph is always reducible to a tree by removing just one edge.
 *
 * If there are multiple answers, return the edge that occurs last in the input.
